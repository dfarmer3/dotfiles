# My Dotfiles (System Configuration)
<hr>

As you may see, I am a wannabe apple dark-mode fanboy who happens to prefer thinkpads over macbooks. I plan to dualboot/hackintosh my x230 once it comes back from china (1080p 13.3" mod ðŸ˜Ž) but at the moment I'm still rocking Fedora Linux.

### X1 Carbon 3rd Gen (1440p):

# Setup Summary
These are configuration files for my multiple Linux configurations. Old-Arch-Setup contains a KDE+i3wm setup that I used to use before switching to my current XFCE setup. `xfce-panel-profiles` contains XFCE settings for my `Macintosh 98` (current) and `Windows 98` setups.

This repo basically serves as a way to preserve the countless hours I've spent meticulously customizing my nerd computer setup, as well as a sort of art project to ~~flex on the normies~~ show off my sorta-artistic skills with (I do have a life, thanks for asking ðŸ˜‚). I have file sparsely organized, but for the most part I use my `copyconfig` script to organize my config directories.

My current setup utilizes the XFCE desktop manager, which is the lightest and most customizable DE I can find that allows for free-floating windows. I can tile my windows using keybinds within XFCE settings, but I plan on switching to a full tiling DE (bspwm) once I get a break from school to "work on" my Linux config again. KDE is my favorite overall, but XFCE sits at a really nice sweet spot between a "modern-like" and "tiling-and-slim" desktop manager so I'm currently messing with it.

`Arc-Dark` is my theme for my window manager, and I am currently using `Breeze Dark` for my icons. `Chicago95` is hella sexually appealing, but I used it for a super long time and sorta got sick of it. Basically, dark mode is for the ðŸ˜Ž uber ðŸ˜Ž cool ðŸ˜Ž kids ðŸ˜Ž and Arc-Dark + Breeze Dark matches the rest of my dark setup better than Chicago95's retro 90's-ness anyways.

For my terminal, I utilize the all-holy trinity (`Vim`, `Zsh`, and `Tmux` for the unenlightened). `Kate` is likely my second favorite text editor for quick edits, while `Spyder` and `VS Code` are my go-tos for more elaborate programming outside of the terminal. I like `Konsole` as my terminal program solely because I came from KDE and like to use KDE applications (they're all virtually identical anyhow, but KDE apps [konsole,kate] are total ass to write colorschemes for so I might switch later lol). My PDF viewer is `Okular` since it allows me to hide all of the annoying toolbars and such, and for my bluelight filter I use `Redshift` for the ability to quickly run it in a seperate tmux window within a few keypresses.

# Set Custom Screen Resolution

_Useful for when the really expensive 1440p screen on your X1 Carbon breaks internally at the far edges and you're too poor to buy a Macbook Pro:_

```zsh
cvt 2464 1440
```

Output: `Modeline "2464x1440_60.00" 299.25 2464 ... [a bunch of numbers] ... -hsync +vsync`

```zsh
xrandr --newmode "2464x1440_60.00" 299.25 2464 2640 2904 3344 1440 1443 1453 1493 -hsync +vsync
xrandr --listmonitors # ... eDP-1
xrandr --addmode eDP-1 "2464x1440_60.00"
xrandr --output eDP-1 --mode "2464x1440_60.00"
